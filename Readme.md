# Pixel To Prototype

## ðŸ“– Introduction

Welcome to my **CAD Repo**, a focused initiative for me to master **Computer-Aided Design (CAD)** through hands-on modeling, precision design, and mechanical systems thinking. 

This repository is solely dedicated to **CAD-related work** and is part of a broader track journey to become a **world-class software engineer and mechanical product designer**.

> This repo isnâ€™t just about modeling â€” itâ€™s about building a design mindset.
