# Pixel To Prototype

## Introduction

Welcome to my **CAD Repo**, a focused initiative for me to master **Computer-Aided Design (CAD)** through hands-on modeling, precision design, and mechanical systems thinking. 

This repository is solely dedicated to **CAD-related work** and is part of a broader track journey to become a **world-class software engineer and mechanical product designer**.

> This repo isn’t just about modeling — it’s about building a design mindset.

---

## Objectives

- Develop **daily 3D models** based on real mechanical components or conceptual parts.
- Strengthen proficiency with **SolidWorks**, **Fusion 360**, and **AutoCAD**.
- Master **parametric design**, **assemblies**, and **dimensioning best practices**.
- Build a digital portfolio showcasing both **technical skill** and **design thinking**.
- Move steadily toward my long-term goal of becoming a **CAD expert and mechanical systems innovator**.
